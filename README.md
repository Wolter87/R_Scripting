# R_Scripting
First try in R_scripting

I began with researching R and tried some of the possibilities in R. The file R-Code trails.R is full of these 'trials'.
I have tried to make a few shiny-apps with actual visualisations of data, but sadly none of them worked for me.

Eventually I starten building on a Shiny-app which you could use to upload a CSV file and browse the file. This app is made for a specific type of file with specific layout.
